## Course Overview

The Data Structures Class is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of fundamental data structures and their applications. Throughout this course, you will learn about various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, and explore their implementation and usage in solving real-world problems efficiently.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to Data Structures
- Recursion `lab2` and  `p2`
- Stacks & Queues `p1`
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees) `lab3` and `p3`
- Heaps and Priority Queues `lab4`
- Hash Tables `p4`
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms `lab5`
- Big O notation and time complexity `lab2` and `lab5`
- STL `p5`

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of programming concepts and algorithms. Familiarity with a programming language like C++, or Python would be beneficial.

To run all of the projects, run `make` where a MakeFile is present. If not teh standard `g++ <file.cpp> -Werror -Wall -pedantic -0 <executable>` should work. Swap `<file.cpp>` and `<xecutable>`. After that press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and you should be all set!
